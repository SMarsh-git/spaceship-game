# spaceship_game
Python game to be played in the terminal. The game is a science fiction adventure game with an unintended resemblance to Among Us. This project was completed in a week with a group of other students.

All inputs for the command line are explained in the command line after running the file. I personally designed this game in VisualStudioCode, using its inbuilt terminal.
